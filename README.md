# Activity Setup: Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up your coding environment for today's activity.

1. Fork This Repository
Click the Fork button in the top-right corner of this page. This will create your own personal copy of the project in your GitHub account.

2. Launch Your Codespace
On your newly forked repository page, click the green < > Code button, select the Codespaces tab, and then click Create codespace on main. This will launch a full VS Code editor in your browser.

3. Open the Terminal
Once the editor loads, open the terminal to get ready for your first commands. You can do this by pressing Ctrl + ` (control + backtick) or by going to the Terminal menu and selecting New Terminal.

You are now ready to begin the "Tell a Story with Commits" activity.
